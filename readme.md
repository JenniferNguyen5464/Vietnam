## Reflection
I have some issues with my background image as when i resizze the web it only works for the big screen and and i make it small. 
Cool things i added for a better feel is in gallery you can hover over the images to make it pop out or you can click on the images where it opens up the image and added light box. Smooth Scrolling for Navigation and got back to the top by pressing tab it will bring you back up to the top and when you press the space bar it will go down a bit each time.

i wanted to add arrows in the gallery for when you clicked on the image you can swipe right or left to go back and forth without needing to click in and out to see the next picture

im open to learning anything
